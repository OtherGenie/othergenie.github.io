  "title": "What is survivorship bias?",
  "summary": "Survivorship Bias is a cognitive error that occurs when people focus on successful individuals, neglecting the many others who have failed, which leads to an overestimation of the chances of success. This bias arises from the media spotlighting only successful musicians, authors, and entrepreneurs, while failures remain largely invisible. For example, Rick, inspired by rock stars, mistakenly believes he too can succeed in the music industry without considering the thousands of failed musicians. In investment scenarios, like with the Dow Jones index, only surviving companies are represented, which skews perception. To combat this bias, one must acknowledge the countless unsuccessful attempts that go unreported and the traits shared by both successful and failed individuals, and visit the 'graveyards' of failed ventures to understand the true odds of success.",
